"Well planned, relevant and fantastic course instructor!",1
"Talk about punctuality, it's really good but the lecture delivery is somehow not appreciated because every teacher has different style of teaching, so lack of knowledge in terms of subject is there and interaction is also kind of boring. A teacher should be entertaining as well but they are really not. All they want us to be studios and disciplined which is really not the thinking of every student.",
"Exam pattern is up to the mark and the Cgpa depends on the various marks distributions like ca, mte etc which is very nice as compare to other institutions. Paper checking does not depend on length of ques but on the material which is the best part of it.",
Good marks distribution Students can easily check there performance throught the semester,
"Exam pattern and how it is conducted is really seems to be good but it's my first year and when I went to scrutiny for the first time it was not as per my expectations. Teachers have marked the answers as per their choice, they must look for the content rather than the length of answers. So poor paper checking is there.",
exam pattern and marks distribution is very well procedure,
Examination pattern is good but marks distribution very confusing,
fair marking scheme and adaptable pattern,
Very Tough,
exam  pattern is very good but if you give question papers to students it is helpful ,
content of courses are average,
All courses material provide very good knowledge in depth .,
This semester university has provide best teachers ,
"Knowledge,depth of course is good but course material are not upto the mark",
Material of the course is not good enough ,
"The materials or links provided for study purpose is good, clarity in depth of courses but again it differs from teacher to teacher.",
content of the courses are update and mostly based on current technology.,
Teachers are not giving depth of course . They trying to cover there work only .,
Satisfied,
The books that are recommended do not contain appropriate content; leads the students to depend on slides given by teachers. Hence the knowledge remains superficial,
Courses are very good and useful ,
content is good enough,
Accurate,
well planned,
the material provided is beneficial and provides much knowledge,
content is very knowledgable and gives us huge knowledge of every subject,
good quallity content but some teachers donot upload ppts on time,
some courses are irrelevant as they are not related to my stream.,
there are many courses which are irrelevant to the branch. some topics are not covered. There is no proper material for any course,
not too bad,
depth of course is less on the other hand knowledge and material is good,
sometime it is irrelevent with the ongoing courses.,
some of them are very helpful and knowledgeable and some are just formality,
"very knowledgeable, some subjects do not have dedicated material like books available",
it is not appropriate,
"Good, but there should be at least one a practical subject in every semester",
The course structure is good and follows todays technology. Some subjects portion are too vast and are difficult to cover in 1 sem,
Content of the courses should be changed a bit. More of industry oriented feature like Linux and GitHub must be implemented. Proper detailing and advanced knowledge is required and is to be instilled in the students.The course material is good.,
Excellent,
very good and you can also increase the standard of Courses,
The courses available in the university have got a scope and the teaching of these courses goes on with the point of view of bringing out the best from the student by indulging them in different activities and projects.,
syllabus is more which required time ..it should b less so that student can proper concentrate getting the knowlegde instead of just covering the syllabusgood,
the content of the course should be increased with the depth.,
In my opnion very less content is their in our syllabus..it will be good if there is more syllabus and depth included in our syllabus,
some of the faculty are not uploading ppts,
it is good learning these courses,
content is sufficient for us ,
Some subjects are good and predictable.Remaining courses are not satisfactory,
The depth of course is very much  deep. According to me its very essential,
depth  of course was good ....providing a basic knowledge not so deep in subjects....at least they should provide deep knowledge and syllabus in core subjects...,
I like this very much because every subject is linked up with real life situations and every thing in the subject is use full,
"depth of the course are depended on the level of student intake, course material is delivered after the class in UMS 

",
good,
Pretty Good ,
Is good,
not good enough.. we want something more.,
good,
LESS TIME FOR STUDY ...LESS TIME FOR PAPER ATTEMTING...LESS TIME FOR EVERY THING ....LESS KNOWLEGE.....LESS DEPTH OF COURSE .....BUT PROPER COURSE MATERIAL ACCORDING TO EXAM,
knowledge is maximum gained by reading books also the teachers explain depth if we are interested to know about it.,
HAVE TO IMPROVE,
every one can tell depth of course but some one only give notes,
we are getting maximum knowledge ,
Knowledge is maximum gained  by reading books and also teachers explain the concept in depth.,
Its fine but it should focus more towards practical knowledge rather than content based. It would be helpful for us.,
HAVE TO IMPROVE,
teacher are punctual but they should also give us the some practical knowledge other than theortical,
Good ,
Excellent lectures are delivered by teachers and all teachers are very punctual.,
Good,
teachers give us all the information required to improve the performance.,
Yes,
good and punctual,
It is good,
Good,
Good,
It's good when compare with my Btech lectures and teaching activities.,
Good,
way of teaching is good,
"University teaching here is very much dependent upon slides,though it is a easy way of teaching but still leaving some concepts unclear..otherwise interaction with the faculty is good.Lecture delivery sometimes is not upto the mark and punctuality is  fine. ",
Good,
Good ,
As compared to other colleges and university our university is perfect in all the aspects,
Good,
Lectures helps in clear our concept,
"not satisfactory, lab work must include latest technologies",
Good ,
Lab work is properly covered in the labs by the faculty and evaluations help to learn more practical knowledge in depth. ,
Good,
practical work provides detail knowledge of theoretical work,
Yes,
Good,
Everything is going fine in lab . learning new things. That is good for us,
Good,
Good,
Lab and practical are not upto the mark. The topic which are practiced are almost already done in Btech.,
Not upto the mark,
lab improves practical knowledge,
Sometimes systems at labs are screwed up .Otherwise everything is  at their respected desk.,
Good,
Good,
Practical work is fair,
Good,
Practical and easy learning,
"Talk about punctuality, it's really good but the lecture delivery is somehow not appreciated because every teacher has different style of teaching, so lack of knowledge in terms of subject is there and interaction is also kind of boring.

"University is very good at delivering proper lectures,also the interaction with students is descent. Sometimes the teachers lack in terms of punctuality but overall university is giving a good input. ",
lecturer are punctual and can interact them easily.,
Punctuality is good. Most of the teachers are not interacting with students .,
Good,
lecture delivery is not so good,
"Discipline, punctuality , lecture delivery all are good but hv to do some work for quality of lecture",
"Interaction is very good,accurate supplement material is provided but recommendation of books is very poor,the change of a particular teacher after 3 months or a semester of same subject causes problems",
Perfect,
It is really gud,
Very good teaching and management but too much load on student and working hours,
in terms of lecture delivery that is good.in terms of punctuality that is also good but in terms of intraction that is very bad. There are some teachers they donot interact and do not litsn our problms that means they do not coprate.,
According to me everything is going well in accordance to interaction.More than enough is served. ,
Very good teaching and management but too much load on student and working hours,
not effective and satisfactory in terms of lecture delivery by all the faculty .,
Good,
Good,
Accurate,
It's good,

"maintained punctuality, good lecture delivery",
average,

Good,
Average,
3 hours practical is so long. It should be of 2 hours only ,
Good,
ok ok,
practicle must be of 2 hours,
"It's good 
Also depends on teacher's knowledge and student's interest",
All good,
Average ,
Too much lanlb file work,
Evaluation method is gud.But the content is more to write in file,
excellent,
Its good,
I think electrotherapy practical should be of 2 hours.That's enough I think.Rest is fine.,
excellent,
lab duration of 3 hours is very long . ,
Average,
Good,
Good,
It's good,
It's good,
lab evaluations are pretty good .they help us a lot.,
having good material in labs.,
too much good,
good,
average,
it is difficult to understand experiment in 1 hour,
good,
good,
good,
lab work is also good,
lab work is quite good,
lab activities are good but not satisfactory in explaining point of view.,
helps in improving skills,
lab work is nice.,
practical work including evaluations are good so that students can learn about practicals.,
laboratory provides us a good knowledge about practicals.,
good,
practical work insome labs are not upto the marks,
labs are good but experiments are not very informative,
"it is quite good , depends upon teacher and their experience",
the way of teaching is good but the time more than enough,
good teaching delivery,
"good, teacher is delivery the lecture in the best way they can",
good and qualified teachers but few lacks in interaction with students and fails to describe a topic,
average,
"very good teaching facilities, lecture given are fruitful and teachers are punctual",
interaction is good but not with mostly male lecturers.punctuality is maintained by everyone but lecture delivery not peak quality.,
all things are good,
This is the best in our university because there is no other university which takes seriously for practical work.,
"some time lab is not proper working , some teacher's practical knowledge is less on the other side evaluations is not that much good   ",
Good,
satisfactory,
very poor.no equipments are there,
poor,
very poor.no equipments are there,
lab practicals and evaluations are below average and need lot of changes and improvements,
lab practical work can further be improved so that it can meet industrial standards,
excellent work,
good,
good,
good,
very good,
its hard to find a computer working in lab. Students cannot save data in one single PC,
good,
"Not good, becouse in lab teachers donot teach us how to work on live projects or how to make a live project. So i have ovserved that whatever teachers have been teachig us in lab that will not usefull in our future life.",
not good..the timing is too much for labs and syllabus is also so vast.we don't get propr revision,
All is good. no other university is so serious about the concept of practicals.,
"lecture delivery depends on teacher's knowledge, punctuality is good",
Good,
way of teaching is average,
not so good,
average,
good,
the staff is highly punctual ad interactive and encourage students to participate in the class,

Excellent but it depends upon teacher,
some teachers aren't doing their jobs in very well manner,
Some of the teachers are not well experienced but they are interactive and helpful and punctual.,
not all the teachers are teaching well but it's fine,
EXCELLENT,
"The faculty is good ,interaction between student and teacher is also good",
not good,
Good,
Good,
some of our faculty member are not so experienced that's why most of the time we are facing problems subjects like CSE(c++),
good,
its to good ,
everything is good ,
"everything is good but when coming to some lectures who dont have a good grip on subject,they dont behave well with students and they dont even teach all the concepts in the subject. ",
excellent,
"everything was good regarding to university but, some lecturers don't have grip on the subject and lag in the teaching",
With the help of practicals students are able to understand all the concept.so it is also good.,
LAB IS VERY GOOD,
good,
not good...... must be improve,
Lab evaluations are good.,
it was good but it can be improved,
"most of the teacher don't even bother about the practical performed by students.They give marks just by seeing face or something like that.
",
good  but marks are not given properly ,
good,
Excellent,
practicals are good but evaluations are not because they don't give enough time to work ,
They are conducted in proper way.,
Teachers are supposed to let the students know the actual use of the instruments used in the lab.,
excellent ...they  work hard..their way of teaching is also pretty good,
average 3.5/5,
good,
"In labs,the lecturers has to interact with each student to improve their knowledge, in all the ways,before giving us the work they must explain about the experiment once so that we will come to know how to perform n take precautions while doing,........
",
Good,
ok,
its fine.,
good,
More number of lab/practicals should be there to enhance practical knowledge.,
Here we r able to do every thing by our own with u r valuable support ,
The examination pattern is good .But time is not sufficient for those questions.,
MCQ pattern is quite good and efficient way for evolving students.,
all labs and practical going on well,
not bad,
Labs are upto the mark.,
Our labs do not have all facalities. ,
ALL PRACTICAL WORK IS GOOD,
